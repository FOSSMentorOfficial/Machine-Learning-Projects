|----|----|----|----|
- The objective of the project is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
- The data set that has used in this project has taken from the Kaggle. "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  
- Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage".
- The model best worked on this dataset is Random Forest Classifier.
- **Accuracy achieved = 98.75%**
